## Diabetes Data Visualization and Prediction App

This Streamlit application provides an interactive platform for visualizing and analyzing a diabetes dataset. It includes various plots and charts to help users understand the distribution and relationships between different features related to diabetes. Additionally, the app integrates a pre-trained machine learning model to predict whether a user is diabetic based on their input details.

Diabetes is a chronic condition characterized by high levels of sugar (glucose) in the blood. The two main types are Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes occurs when the body does not produce insulin, a hormone needed to regulate blood sugar. It is usually diagnosed in children and young adults and requires insulin therapy for management. Type 2 diabetes, the more common form, occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or does not produce enough of it, leading to elevated blood sugar levels. This type of diabetes is typically diagnosed in adults and managed through lifestyle changes, medications, and sometimes insulin therapy.

The app allows users to explore key features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI, and age. Visualizations include histograms for age, BMI, glucose, and insulin distributions, a bar plot for diabetes outcomes, a correlation heatmap, and box plots for multiple features to highlight data distribution and outliers.

Furthermore, users can input their own data to determine their likelihood of having diabetes using the integrated pre-trained model. This predictive functionality aims to provide users with a useful tool for preliminary diabetes risk assessment based on their personal health metrics.
